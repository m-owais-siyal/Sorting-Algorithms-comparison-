# Graphical Web-Based Comparison of Sorting Algorithms

This project provides a graphical web-based comparison of various sorting algorithms, making them easier to understand. Each sorting algorithm is implemented in its own HTML file with visualizations to help demonstrate how the algorithms work step-by-step.

## Overview

Sorting algorithms are fundamental in computer science, and understanding their differences is crucial for efficient algorithm selection. This project includes visual representations of several sorting algorithms to facilitate a deeper understanding of their inner workings.

## Algorithms Implemented

The following sorting algorithms are included in this project:

- **Bucket Sort** (`Bucket.html`)
- **Count Range Sort** (`CountRange.html`)
- **Heap Sort** (`Heap.html`)
- **Modified Sort** (`ModifiedSort.html`)
- **Quick Sort** (`Quick.html`)
- **Radix Sort** (`Radix.html`)
- **Bubble Sort** (`bubble.html`)
- **Counting Sort** (`counting.html`)
- **Insertion Sort** (`insertion.html`)
- **Merge Sort** (`merge.html`)

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/m-owais-siyal/Sorting-Algorithms-comparison-.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Sorting-Algorithms-comparison-
    ```
3. Open `main.html` in your web browser to access the main interface where you can select and view the sorting algorithms.
